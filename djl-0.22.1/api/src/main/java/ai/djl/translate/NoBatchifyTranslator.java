 * A {@link Translator} that does not use a {@link Batchifier}.

 *
 * <p>First, you want to translate between {@link ai.djl.training.dataset.Batch}es rather than
 * {@link ai.djl.training.dataset.Record}s. For example, you might go from String[] to Int[].
 *
 * <p>The second option is when using a model that does not use batching. Then, the model expects
 * only a single record at a time.
