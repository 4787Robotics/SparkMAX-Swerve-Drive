/**
 * A class to manage 1-D {@link NDArray} representations of multiple words.
 *
 * <p>A text embedding differs from a {@link ai.djl.modality.nlp.embedding.WordEmbedding} because
 * the text embedding does not have to be applied to each word independently.
 *
 * <p>A text embedding maps text to a {@link NDArray} that attempts to represent the key ideas in
 * the words. Each of the values in the dimension can represent different pieces of meaning such as
 * young-old, object-living, etc.
 *
 * <p>These text embeddings can be used in two different ways in models. First, they can be used
 * purely for preprocessing the model. In this case, it is a requirement for most models that use
 * text as an input. The model is not trained. For this use case, use {@link #embedText}.
 *
 * <p>In the second option, the embedding can be trained using the standard deep learning techniques
 * to better handle the current dataset. For this case, you need two methods. First, call {@link
 * #preprocessTextToEmbed(List)} within your dataset. Then, the first step in your model should be
 * to call {@link #embedText(NDManager, long[])}.
