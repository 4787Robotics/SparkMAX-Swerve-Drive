# DJL - PaddlePaddle model zoo

The PaddlePaddle model zoo contains symbolic models that can be used for inference.
All the models in this model zoo contain pre-trained parameters for their specific datasets.

## Documentation

The latest javadocs can be found on [here](https://javadoc.io/doc/ai.djl.paddlepaddle/paddlepaddle-model-zoo/latest/index.html).

You can also build the latest javadocs locally using the following command:

```sh
# for Linux/macOS:
./gradlew javadoc

# for Windows:
..\..\gradlew javadoc
```
The javadocs output is built in the build/doc/javadoc folder.

## Installation
You can pull the [ai.djl.paddlepaddle:paddlepaddle-model-zoo](https://search.maven.org/artifact/ai.djl.paddlepaddle/paddlepaddle-model-zoo)
from the central Maven repository by including the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>ai.djl.paddlepaddle</groupId>
    <artifactId>paddlepaddle-model-zoo</artifactId>
    <version>0.22.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Pre-trained models

The PaddlePaddle model zoo contains Computer Vision (CV) models.

* CV
  * Face Detection: Detect faces in the image
  * Mask Classification: Detect mask 
  * Word Detection: Find word blocks in the image
  * Word Orientation Classification: Find if rotate image is needed
  * Word Recognition: Recognize text from image
