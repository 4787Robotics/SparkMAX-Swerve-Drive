# DJL - PyTorch native Library

## Introduction
This project builds the JNI layer for Java to call PyTorch C++ APIs.
You can find more information in the `src`.

## Prerequisite
You need to install `cmake` and C++ compiler on your machine in order to build

### Linux

```
apt-get install -y locales cmake curl unzip software-properties-common
```

## CPU Build

Use the following task to build PyTorch JNI library:

### Mac/Linux

```
./gradlew compileJNI
```

### Windows

```
gradlew compileJNI
```

This task will send a Jni library copy to `pytorch-engine` model to test locally.

## GPU build
Note: PyTorch C++ library requires CUDA path set in the system.

Use the following task to build pytorch JNI library for GPU:

### Mac/Linux

```
# compile CUDA 11.X version of JNI
./gradlew compileJNI -Pcu11
```

## Windows

```
# compile CUDA 11.X version of JNI
gradlew compileJNI -Pcu11
```

### Format C++ code
It uses clang-format to format the code.

```
./gradlew formatCpp
```

## PyTorch native package release

### Step 1: Build new JNI on top of new libtorch on osx, linux-cpu, linux-gpu, windows

1. Spin up a EC2 instance for linux, linux-gpu, windows, windows-gpu and cd pytorch/pytorch-native.
2. Run ./gradlew compileJNI and resolve all the issues you are facing.
3. Raise a PR for the JNI code change and donâ€™t merge it until we have the rest things ready.

### Step 2: Check dependencies of each JNI

1. check the dependencies of each JNI library by `otool -L libdjl_torch.dylib` for osx, `ldd libdjl_torch.so` for linux and `dumpbin /dependents libdjl_torch.dll` for windows.
2. Compare all dependency libraries to those in downloadPyTorchNativeLib, if we miss copying new dependencies, correct the script.
3. modify the version to desired release version in pytorch/pytorch-native/build.gradle and make sure the URL in the task downloadPyTorchNativeLib point to the right, available URL. Usually the URL that is not for the latest version will have %2Bcpu/cuXXX in the end.
4. Make corresponding change on build.sh  and build.cmd
5. Raise PR for script change and get them merge

### Step 3: Upload the new version of libtorch dependencies to S3

1. Spin up a EC2 instance and `cd pytorch/pytorch-native && ./gradlew dPTNL`
2. `cd build/native/lib` and gzip all dependencies (`gzip -r download`)
3. Create a new pytorch-X.X.X in ai.djl/publish bucket with djl-prod account.
4. `aws s3 sync build/native/lib s3://djl-ai/publish/pytorch-X.X.X`

### Step 4: Build new JNI and upload to S3: 

1. Merge the JNI code change.
2. Now every script should point to new PyTorch version except integration and example are still using old pytorch-native version
3. Trigger Native JNI S3 PyTorch and resolve issues if any

### Step 5: Build pytorch-native snapshot

1. Trigger Native Snapshot PyTorch
2. Raise a PR to bump up all PyTorch version to new version and add -SNAPSHOT
3. Test integration test , example and pytorch-engine unit test with snapshot pytorch-native

### Step 6: Publish pytorch-native to staging

1. Trigger Native Release PyTorch
2. Test integration test, example and pytorch-engine unit test with staging pytorch-native
3. Publish to sonatype 
4. Raise a PR to remove all the -SNAPSHOT
