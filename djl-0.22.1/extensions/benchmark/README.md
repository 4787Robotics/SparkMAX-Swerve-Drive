# Benchmark your DL model

dll-bench is a command line tool that makes it easy for you to benchmark the model on different
platforms.

With djl-bench, you can easily compare your model's behavior in different use cases, such as:

- single-threaded vs. multi-threaded
- single input vs. batched inputs
- CPU vs. GPU or other hardware accelerator
- Single GPU vs. multiple GPUs
- default engine options vs. customized engine configuration
- running with different engines
- running with different version of the engine
