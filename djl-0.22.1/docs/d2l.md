# Dive into Deep Learning

Dive into Deep Learning (D2L) is a book that teaches all of the concepts of deep learning. It covers topics including the basics of deep learning, gradient descent, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, and generative adversarial networks.

The DJL edition is our adaptation of the [original open source book](http://d2l.ai/). Instead of using python like the original, we modified it to use Java and DJL concepts in the text. If you are looking for a more comprehensive understanding of deep learning or more focus on the fundamentals, this is the best resource to use.
